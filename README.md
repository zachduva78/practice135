## Virtual Environment

To isolate your workspace from other projects, and also make it easier for you/others to reproduce the environment (i.e., imported dependencies), consider a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

1. `python -m venv venv`
2. Depends upon OS...

    * Mac/Linux/Bash: `source venv/bin/activate`
